**Tone**: Storytelling, problem-solution narrative, inspiring

---

## 🎭 ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 1:00)

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: Show a developer frustrated with multiple browser tabs, terminal windows, blockchain explorers]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Imagine you're building a payment system on Cronos. You need to send tokens, check balances, estimate gas costs... but here's the problem."

**[Screen: Show the complexity - switching between MetaMask, explorer, RPC calls, manual calculations]**

**NARRATION:**
> "You're juggling multiple tools. MetaMask for transactions. Block explorers for verification. Manual calculations for gas. And if something goes wrong? Good luck debugging."

### The Pain Point (0:15 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Show code with try-catch blocks, nonce management bugs, failed transactions]**

**NARRATION:**
> "And it gets worse. Want to send to multiple recipients? You're writing batch scripts. Need conditional logic? You're building custom smart contracts. Want to know WHY a transaction failed? You're digging through logs for hours."

### The Gap (0:30 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Show comparison - Crypto.com AI SDK vs traditional tools]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Now, Cronos has the Crypto.com AI Agent SDK - which is great for simple transfers. But what if you need MORE? What if you need to SEE your transaction flow before executing? What if you need EXPLAINABILITY for compliance? What if you need DEVELOPER TOOLS that actually understand natural language?"

**[Screen: Fade to black, then show CronoPay logo]**

**NARRATION:**
> "That's where CronoPay comes in."
